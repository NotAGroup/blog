## Combat System & Enemy Behavior

To improve code clarity, old unused scripts for the swords were removed.
Furthermore, the hit zone and opponent classes were made abstract in order to inherit them and avoid code duplication.

The behavior of the melee skeleton has been revised.
As soon as it reaches a nav point, the skeleton turns toward the center of the room to look around.
This increases the probability that the player will be seen.
If the skeleton is hit by an arrow while walking, it now stops and turns in the direction the arrow came from.

These changes are preparations to enable additional types of opponents.
We are currently working on adding a ranged skeleton.
A corresponding prefab has already been created, and the corresponding animator controller that uses the necessary animations is currently being created.

The number of error messages caused by the RuntimeNavMeshBuilder has been drastically reduced.
To achieve this, models that are irrelevant for the movement freedom of opponents have been moved to other layers.
For models that are relevant, the NavMeshObstacle component has been moved to the correct object.
This led to a more reliable construction of the NavMesh.
Now only TextMesh Pro meshes cause error messages at startup, even though they are located in their own UI layer, which should be ignored by the RuntimeNavMeshBuilder.
