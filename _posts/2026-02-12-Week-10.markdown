## UI/Input (Feedback from Demo Session)

From the demo session we got valuable feedback concerning input and ui which I implemented this week. 
It includes 

- Moving items in the inventory (now, we use two colors to highlight slots when moving items: one for the currently selected slot and one for the slot that the item is taken from)
- Gamepad input for main menu, pause and death screen
- Missing mapping for pause on gamepad
- look sensitivity on gamepad

and other small fixes.


## Dungeon Generation: Decorations

Another point frequently mentioned in feedback was the fact that the levels look very empty.
For this reason, I extended the dungeon generation algorithm such that it can also
place random decorative assets in the level and added some assets.

So far, I added piles of rocks and pieces of wood as decorations. I created these
by modeling a handful of different rocks and pieces of wood and placed them onto 
a circle using the scatter-on-surface-modifier in blender.

Similarly, I also created a pile of rubble where I used a simple voronoi texture 
on the base model and scattered rocks on its surface.

Finally, I created a very basic puddle of water, which consists of a deformed circle
and a transparent and reflective material. I also simulate water drops falling from 
the ceiling using a particle system (with drops creating 'splashes' in the water
using a second particle system).
