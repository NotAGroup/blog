## Inventory UI:

Added Scripts and prefabs for displaying and managing the players inventory.

<img width="300" alt="Inventory UI, moving items between slots" src="{{ '/images/inventory.gif' | relative_url }}">

Currently, the inventory can be opened by pressing 'E'. 
Item slots can be selected using WASD-keys. An item can be grabbed by pressing space and then moved using WASD.

Also, analogously to the hotbar for items, a hotbar for currencies is added.

## Player stats and upgrades

Added Scripts and prefabs to implement upgrades of player stats. 
Here, I distinguish between base stats (health, dexterity, ...) that can be upgraded (the level simply being an integer each) and gameplay-stats that depend on base stats and influence gameplay (movement speed, max-health,...).

The StatScalingDefinitions-Component provides definitions on how to compute gameplay-stats from base-stats. It is added to the "Definitions"-Prefab to allow configuring of these values. 
Further, it is possible to create different definitions-prefabs to define different levels of difficulty.
