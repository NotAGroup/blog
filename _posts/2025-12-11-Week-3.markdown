## Inventory UI:

Added Scripts and prefabs for displaying and managing the players inventory.

Currently, the inventory can be opened by pressing 'E'.
Item slots can be selected using WASD-keys.
An item can be grabbed by pressing space and then moved using WASD.

Also, analogously to the hotbar for items, a hotbar for currencies is added.

## Player stats and upgrades

Added Scripts and prefabs to implement upgrades of player stats.
Here, I distinguish between base stats (health, dexterity, ...) that can be upgraded (the level simply being an integer each) and gameplay-stats that depend on base stats and influence gameplay (movement speed, max-health,...).

The StatScalingDefinitions-Component provides definitions on how to compute gameplay-stats from base-stats. It is added to the "Definitions"-Prefab to allow configuring of these values.
Further, it is possible to create different definitions-prefabs to define different levels of difficulty.

## Assets:

Textures were created for the wall, pillar and wall torch models to give them a stone-like appearance.

Appropriate textures and materials were also created for the ceiling and floor to match the dungeon.

Enemies and destructible objects should be able to drop coins.
These can be used by players to purchase items in the shop.
A model of a pile of coins with appropriate textures and materials was created in Blender for this purpose.

Currently, the player only shoots gray balls as projectiles.
To enable the player to shoot arrows as an archer in the future, a suitable model with textures was also created.
