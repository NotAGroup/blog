## Assets

This week, Guanpu Tian added our first boss monster model.
The model represents some sort of demonic overlord.
Appropriate textures and materials were created for this model.

## Enemy Behavior

To eliminate the glitch that caused our two opponent types to freeze during combat,
the base class and the two skeleton classes were reworked again.
Several variables that allowed the skeletons to enter an undefined state, from which they could not recover,
were removed and replaced with an enum variable for determining their state.
This ensured the desired state stability.
Furthermore, for better handling, we switched to coroutines for the hit zone and projectiles.
This allows us to better coordinate with the animations without the need for all the timers in the update function.

## Level Generation (Items)

Improved loot placement in the level. 
Until now, we only had chests with some random items as loot.

Now, I implemented attaching loot to any object such that the loot gets dropped 
on destruction. With that, we can attach loot to enemies and have them drop it 
when dying. 

I improved the level generation such that first, a budget of loot is sampled.
Here, the level parameters are used (available gold, available xp, ammunition per enemy).
Then, when placing chests and enemies in the scene, random loot from that budget
can be added to them.
Further, now the dungeon creator also places one large chest in the level, which
has more loot. The loot for this large chest is sampled from an exponential 
distribution (independent of loot budget), to make it more unpredictable.

## Level Generation

Tweaked torch placement such that we have them slightly further spaced.
Increased the intensity of torches such that the dungeon remains bright enough.
Also, until now we had 3 light sources per torch, which I now replaced by one
such that we dont get issues with limitations in the number of light sources.

### Enemies spawning

Enhanced enemy spawning. Now these get spawned in a (poisson distributed)
number of groups, each with a poisson distributed number of enemies.

I use poisson distributions because they make it easy to balance the expected
amount and expected number of enemy groups per level, while still achieving
a lot of perceived randomness and unpredictability.
