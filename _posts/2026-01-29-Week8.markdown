## Assets

This week, Guanpu Tian added our first boss monster model.
The model represents some sort of demonic overlord.
Appropriate textures and materials were created for this model.

## Enemy Behavior

To eliminate the glitch that caused our two opponent types to freeze during combat,
the base class and the two skeleton classes were reworked again.
Several variables that allowed the skeletons to enter an undefined state, from which they could not recover,
were removed and replaced with an enum variable for determining their state.
This ensured the desired state stability.
Furthermore, for better handling, we switched to coroutines for the hit zone and projectiles.
This allows us to better coordinate with the animations without the need for all the timers in the update function.
