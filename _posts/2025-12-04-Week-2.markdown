## Items:

Added Scripts for item definitions and player inventory.
Implemented the ItemDefiner component which is intended to be used as a singleton
in the scene, attached to a prefab where the definitions can be edited.
For an item, attributes such as display-name, models for rendering, probabilities
(for being available in shops or in chests) can be defined.

Further, the Inventory-component is added, which stores the players items in a
configurable number of slots.

For visualization using a hotbar, ui components are added. Available items
are shown at the bottom of the screen. Usage using number keys has already been implemented.

For now, no item models are shown in the hotbar, as currently, we don't have any 2d assets for
the items. Solutions have to be discussed with the asset creators.
We could: manually create 2D-assets, create these automatically or (my least favorite) render the 3D models using an overlay camera.

Small contribution: extracted player stats (max health, etc.) from Player-script into a separate class,
preparing for the future addition of character classes and player levelling.

## Assets:

For the dungeon generation, a low-poly pillar model with a baked normal map was created in Blender to match the walls.

Furthermore, a torch model with a normal, metallic, and diffuse texture was created, and a prefab was made to light up the dungeon.
