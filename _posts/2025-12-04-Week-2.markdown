## Items:

Added Scripts for item definitions and player inventory.
Implemented the ItemDefiner component which is intended to be used as a singleton
in the scene, attached to a prefab where the definitions can be edited.
For an item, attributes such as display-name, models for rendering, probabilities
(for being available in shops or in chests) can be defined.

Further, the Inventory-component is added, which stores the players items in a
configurable number of slots.

For visualization using a hotbar, ui components are added. Available items
are shown at the bottom of the screen. Usage using number keys has already been implemented.

For now, no item models are shown in the hotbar, as currently, we don't have any 2d assets for
the items. Solutions have to be discussed with the asset creators.
We could: manually create 2D-assets, create these automatically or (my least favorite) render the 3D models using an overlay camera.

Small contribution: extracted player stats (max health, etc.) from Player-script into a separate class,
preparing for the future addition of character classes and player levelling.

## Assets:

For the dungeon generation, a low-poly pillar model with a baked normal map was created in Blender to match the walls.

Furthermore, a torch model with a normal, metallic, and diffuse texture was created, and a prefab was made to light up the dungeon.

For the Enemy assets. 2 variations of Skeletton models, with sword and with bow are finished.

And bow and quiver Model.

Animations in processing.

## Wall Creation

With the new Wall Asset from Rene, I implemented the wall creation of the dungeon. It looked to steched out using only one Asset for each Wall
so I had to change the code. The normal Asset with a scaling of (1, 1, 1) has a width of approximatly 4 units in Unity. Therefore the new
function divides the length of the wall by 4 (length of the Wall Asset). With that i get the amount of wall assets i need for one wall.
Additionally a slight offset on the orthogonal axis (not the y-Axis) of the vertical or horizontal Walls is added for some prettier Walls.

## Combat System & Enemy Behavior:

Additional work has been done so that the logic of damage dealing is separate from the visual animations. Damage is now dealt if the player is in an invisible HitZone during the attack of the opponent, rather than checking for collisions with the mesh of the weapon model. In order for the damage to be dealt at an appropriate time during the animation, the HitZone only becomes active during the "Strike" HitState of the attack.
