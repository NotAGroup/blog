## UI

Added a crosshair and a text element to the UI to show that the player can interact with an object.

## Gameplay

Improved the behaviour of projectiles. Switched hit detection from collisions to raycasting which allows arbitrary projectile speeds.
Further, arrows can now stick to objects (disabling physics, i.e. setting rigidbody to be kinematic) and fall down when that object gets destroyed (i.e. enabling physics).
In particular, arrows now get attached to the animation bones of the opponent, thereby also matching its movements.

With these changes, arrows now stay in the scene and can be picked up after being shot.

## Balancing

Added a component to define dungeon properties depending on the level.
These definitions should be used by the dungeon generation algorithm.

## Assets:

Minor flaws in the mesh of the existing bow and quiver models were fixed.
Textures and materials were then created for these models.

Textures and materials were also created for the new warrior model designed by Guanpu Tian.

## Dungeon Creation:

During dungeon generation, instantiated assets are no longer placed arbitrary in the scene hierarchy.
The generated level is divided into segments, and the assets are instantiated as children of these segments.
This makes the scene hierarchy much less cluttered.

Furthermore, ceiling meshes are now also generated. Both the floor and the ceiling now use their intended materials.

Torches are also placed as evenly as possible on the walls so that they can illuminate the dungeon in the future.

## Game Saving

A minor bug that prevented the game save file from loading correctly has been fixed in the game save system developed by David.
