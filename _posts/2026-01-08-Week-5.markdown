# UI

Added a crosshair and a text element to the UI to show that the player can interact with an object.

# Gameplay 

Improved the behaviour of projectiles. Switched hit detection from collisions to raycasting which allows arbitrary projectile speeds. 
Further, arrows can now stick to objects (disabling physics, i.e. setting rigidbody to be kinematic) and fall down when that object gets destroyed (i.e. enabling physics).
In particular, arrows now get attached to the animation bones of the opponent, thereby also matching its movements.

With these changes, arrows now stay in the scene and can be picked up after being shot.

# Balancing

Added a component to define dungeon properties depending on the level.
These definitions should be used by the dungeon generation algorithm.
