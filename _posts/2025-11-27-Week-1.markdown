After we decided what our game should be, we started working on it.

A material for a brick wall with a diffuse, displacement, and normal texture was created.
Which will not be used for now because Unity does not support displacement maps.

Furthermore, a custom low poly wall model with a baked normal map was created for the dungeon generation.

## Shop:

Added scripts and prefabs for a shop.
The shop can be placed into rooms by the level generator
(currently with constant probability for any room, with 3 random items).

The shop displays the available items which can be purchased by looking
at the item and pressing the interaction button.
Currently, as no currency is implemented, the items are free.

Next: proper assets for the shop, currency system, display hint for interaction
