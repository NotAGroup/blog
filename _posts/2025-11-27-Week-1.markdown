After we decided what our game should be, we started working on it.

## Assets:

Finish basic creation of Skeletton soldier.

A material for a brick wall with a diffuse, displacement, and normal texture was created.
Which will not be used for now because Unity does not support displacement maps.

Furthermore, a custom low poly wall model with a baked normal map was created for the dungeon generation.

## Shop:

Added scripts and prefabs for a shop (currently without proper assets).

The shop can be placed into rooms by the level generator
(currently with constant probability for any room, with 3 random items).

The shop displays the available items which can be purchased by looking
at the item and pressing the interaction button.
Positions of the displayed items can be adjusted to fit the shops model
which has to be added in the future.

Currently, as no currency is implemented, the items are free.

## Dungeon Creation
In the previous version a Wall Asset with width and length of 1 was used for creating the walls of the dungeon. This resulted
in a lot of generated Wall Assets in one Dungeon which leads to performance issues. To fix this, the lengths and widths of the
rooms are used as the scale for the Wall Asset and therefore one Wall Asset is used for one Wall. The scaling is not perfect,
but preformancewise its way cheaper but that all has to be worked over again with the new Wall Assets from Rene.

Old Wall Generation vs New Wall Generation
