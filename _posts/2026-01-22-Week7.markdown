## UI

### Sprites

Added sprites for different ui elements, so when don't have to use the default
sprite of unity. The decoration pattern for the windows has been inspired by 
the UI of Skyrim.

### Item rendering

Until now, we couldn't display items in the ui (inventory and hotbar). I created 
a scene with a script that can be used to render arbitrary objects (e.g. items and currencies)
into a texture. The script attaches a callback to the `endCameraRendering`-event of URP
and writes the rendertexture of the camera into a file.
With this scene, we can easily create textures for items with 
consistent lighting.

Unfortunately, I didn't find a way to have the camera background initialized with transparent
pixels. For this reason I currently use a green-screen-like approach where a configured
background color is replaced with transparent pixels.

### Inventory

From player-feedback we concluded that we would like to disallow arrows from
being automatically placed in the hotbar.
I added a filter by specifying per slot what types of items can be 
automatically placed in it. 

Improved item swapping in the inventory. Until now, grabbing an item 
and navigating through the item slots caused the grabbed item to be swapped
to the next slot on each navigation step. This is unintuitive and not 
suited for mouse-based item dragging.
For this reason I rewrote the swapping semantics such that a grabbed item 
is swapped only after releasing it.

Mouse-based item swapping has to be implemented stil.
