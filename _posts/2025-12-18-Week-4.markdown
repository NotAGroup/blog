## Assets:

Since the user is supposed to advance in the game by exploring the dungeon, once they have fully explored a floor and defeated all enemies, there should be a way to proceed to the next level.
To do this, a new floor must be generated.
In order to make this possible, we decided that the player must interact with an element in the game.
In our case, a trapdoor.
This trapdoor was created together with the appropriate base, metallic, and normal textures in Blender.

To enhance our shop, which can be found in the dungeon, a model of an old table was created.
Wood and fabric materials and the corresponding textures were created for this table.

To make the existing skeleton soldier more visually appealing, suitable color and metallic textures were created.

## Level progression

Dungeon creation now places a trapdoor in the room furthest away from the player.
Interacting with the trapdoor after clearing the level takes the player to the next level (simply incrementing a level variable and reloading the scene).
A level counts as completed after all enemies have been eliminated. We could also add other conditions, e.g. finding a specific object (key).

To keep data across levels, a class is added which stores references to the required data
and persists across scene reloads.

The persistent data is registered to the game saving system developed by David.

## Player Upgrades

The player can now upgrade their stats using XP. For this, logic for defining upgrade cost is added. Further, a UI is added that shows current stat levels and allows the player to upgrade them.

Other small contributions: Improved gamepad mappings for UIs and stick-based camera movement. Added the assets for table and trapdoor to the respective prefabs.

## Game Saving
The game can now save to Disk. This allows for things like collected coins and player levels, to not only be kept between runs, but also between game executions.
