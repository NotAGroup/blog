## Assets:

Since the user is supposed to advance in the game by exploring the dungeon, once they have fully explored a floor and defeated all enemies, there should be a way to proceed to the next level.
To do this, a new floor must be generated.
In order to make this possible, we decided that the player must interact with an element in the game.
In our case, a trapdoor.
This trapdoor was created together with the appropriate base, metallic, and normal textures in Blender.
